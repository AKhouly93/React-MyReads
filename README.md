## Description
This is the first project in **Udacity** Front End Web Development Advanced Nanodegree Program, and the final assessment project for **Udacity**'s React Fundamentals course. The project called my reads is an app for searching books and and show them in different shelves (currently reading, want to read, and read).

## Features
1. User can search database for a variety of books.
2. User can mark books as currently reading, want to read, and read.
3. Single-page app with bookmarkable pages. (user can navigate the app via buttons as well as links).

## Acknowledgement 
This project is based on the starter code provided by Udacity. I want to thank my **Udacity** tutor Ahmed Ibrahim for his help making things clear.

## Difficulties
I found it a bit difficult to switch from class component to function component and applying the same steps in the course.

This is the first project in **Udacity** front end web development Advanced nanodegree program, and the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The project called my reads is an app for searching books and and show them in different shelves (currently readinm, want to read, and read).

## Acknowledgement 
This project is based on the starter code provided by Udacity. I want to thank my Udacity totur Ahmed Ibrahim for his help making things clear.

I found it a bit difficult to switch from class component to function component and applying the same steps in the course.
